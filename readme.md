# Duncarin - Unraid Documentation

Detailed explanation of the Unraid server and it's role in the my homelab network. The purpose of this documentation is for non-technical family members to understand what the server does, how it is configured to do that, and why it was configured in the way it is.

## Personal Details

This documentation contains several personal details, but none are so private as to cause alarm. All names, addresses, and emails are easily found on the internet. There are no passwords or keys in the documentation. All passwords are stored outside of this document.


## Built With

This site is built with VS Code and uses only HTML, CSS, and just enough Javacsript to load pages.
All content displayed is in the subfolder "content". New files added to the "content" is manually added to the "sidebar.html" file. There is no automation.


## Deployment

The point is anyone with the slightest experience with HTML can understand and edit this code. All code is meant to run on the simplest of HTML servers without relying on features of any specific webserver (Apache, IIS, NGINX, etc.). 


### Prerequisites

A working webserver.


### Installing

Copy the files to any folder on your webserver then browse to that folder. The site should load.



## Contributing

You are free to steal this code for your own use.
I ask that any improvements you make get returned.

### Giving Back

I am not a good progarmmer/coder. This code could use help - specifically with the styling for behavior on small screens.
