<h1 class="display-4">Syncthing</h1>
<p class="mt-3">The Docker container Syncthing is the service that keeps configured shares on both servers in-sync. This is how content downloaded in High Point appears in Kodi on the TV in Charlotte. Although this is not meant as a backup, this does serve as our off-site copy of the content.</p>

<h4 class="mt-4">Container Properties</h4>
<p class="mt-2">The container selected on the Apps tab in Unraid is the package maintained by "Linuxserver.io".</p>
<p class="mt-2"></p>


<h4 class="mt-4">Syncthing Properties</h4>
<p class="mt-3">Syncthing is managed using a web interface at the address of the Unraid and the port used in the container properties defined above. The image below shows the interface from the <b>HAVEN-NAS3</b> server. On this server are defined two remote devices and several folders which are synced with those devices.</p>
<img src="content/configuration/HAVEN-NAS3_Syncthing_Dashboard.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Syncthing Dashboard">

<p class="mt-4">Defining folders to sync is done by filling in information on several tabs in a modal window that appears when clicking the button "+Add Folder" at the bottom of the list of folders.</p>
<p class="mt-2">The naming convention used on the <b>General</b> tab is meant to identify the remote device and the directory being synced. In the image below, the name indicates that the folder will sync with the directory <b>Home</b> on the <b>NAS4</b> server. At present all folder definitions only synchronize a single directory with a single remote device. If a folder is synchronized between multiple devices the name should be something like <b>NAS4 / 5540 - Home</b></p>
<img src="content/configuration/HAVEN-NAS3_Syncthing_Folder1.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Syncthing Folder configuration">

<p class="mt-4">The <b>Sharing</b> tab is where the devices with which to share are selected. The following image shows the folder is being synced with only the remote device <b>HAVEN-NAS4</b> without an encryption key since the remote device is trusted.</p>
<img src="content/configuration/HAVEN-NAS3_Syncthing_Folder2.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Syncthing Folder configuration">

<p class="mt-4">By default Syncthing will <b>Watch for Changes</b> which will synchronize a folder if a change has been detected. For most folders this works fine. However, on directories with large files (2-3 GB) Syncthing appears to function better with this option unchecked.</p>
<img src="content/configuration/HAVEN-NAS3_Syncthing_Folder3.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="Syncthing Folder configuration">

<p class="mt-4">The following image shows the folder definition for the directory <b>Everyone</b> under the <b>Media</b> share of the remote device <b>NAS4</b>. Here the <b>Watch for Changes</b> option is disabled and the <b>Full Rescan Interval(s)</b> now controls when the folder is scanned for changes.</p>

<h4 class="mt-5">Pausing/Resuming</h4>
<p class="mt-3">The Syncthing GUI provides options for pausing or resuming folders or devices. This is useful for making mass changes to files without Syncthing trying to push the changes to the other side.</p>
<p class="mt-3">For example, assume you have a folder named <b>my stuff</b> with 50GB of files and you want to rename the folder to <b>My Stuff</b> - Linux is case-sensitive and unlike Windows these are two separate folders. If you rename the folder on one end Syncthing will detect the change as a new folder named <b>My Stuff</b> and a deleted folder named <b>my stuff</b> and start copying files to the other end.</p>
<p class="mt-3">A better way to rename the folder is to pause the folder or device on the end with the folder to be renamed, then rename the folders on both ends. After the changes are complete on the remote server un-pause Syncthing on the source end. Syncthing (on both ends) will scan the folders and detect the change. They will compare with each end and determine the files are the same. Until both ends have scanned their folders and detected the change one side my display the device or folder as <b>Out of Sync</b>. This is normal and should resolve itself.</p>

<h5 class="mt-4">Scheduled Pausing/Resuming</h5>
<p class="mt-3">Syncthing does not have a built-in method to schedule pausing folders or devices. During intensive reads/writes, such as those during a synchronization of a folder with many file changes, the server can be distractingly loud in a quiet environment. To address this, the device <b>HAVEN-NAS4</b> is paused in Syncthing running on <b>HAVEN-NAS3</b> each night and resumed each morning.</p>

<p class="mt-3">This is accomplished by issuing API calls to Syncthing running on the NAS from my laptop which is connected to the network 24/7. The commands to issue the API calls are scheduled using cron. The following are examples of crontab entries for cron running on my laptop.</p>

<h4 class="mt-4">Not a Backup</h4>
<p class="mt-3">The primary goal of Syncthing is to copy content from the server in High Point to the server in Charlotte. This satisfies the need to get the files located offsite in-case something were to happen at either site. However, any accidental deletions will be replicated to the other server. An actual backup protects against this type of data loss.</p>
